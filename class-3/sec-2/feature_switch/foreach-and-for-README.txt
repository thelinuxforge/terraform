In Terraform, both for_each and for are used for iterating over collections, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.

1. for_each in Terraform:
Definition: for_each is used to create multiple resources from a map or set of values. It allows you to iterate over a collection and dynamically create multiple instances of a resource, module, or data source.
Usage: Primarily used to create resources where each instance has unique attributes, such as different names, configurations, or other properties.

Key Points:
Only works with sets and maps (not lists).
The key from the map or set is used to uniquely identify each instance of the resource.
Example (Creating multiple EC2 instances):

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  for_each = {
    instance1 = "t2.micro"
    instance2 = "t2.small"
  }
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = each.value  # Access the instance type for each key
  tags = {
    Name = each.key           # Access the key (instance1, instance2) as the name
  }
}

Here, Terraform will create two instances with different instance types (t2.micro and t2.small).

2. for Expression in Terraform:
Definition: for is an expression used to iterate over a collection (lists, sets, or maps) to generate a new collection by applying some logic or transformation. It's often used inside a variable or an attribute to map or filter values.
Usage: Useful for transforming data and creating lists or maps dynamically. It doesn't create resources but is used for data manipulation within a resource definition or output.

Key Points:
Works with lists, sets, and maps.
You can use the for expression to generate new lists/maps from existing ones.

Example (Transforming a list):

variable "instance_types" {
  default = ["t2.micro", "t2.small", "t2.medium"]
}

output "upper_case_types" {
  value = [for type in var.instance_types : upper(type)]
}

This will output the list of instance types in uppercase (["T2.MICRO", "T2.SMALL", "T2.MEDIUM"]).

Key Differences:
for_each is used to create multiple resources based on a collection.
for is used to iterate over collections to transform data within expressions.
Both help you dynamically manage infrastructure and data, but the context in which they are used is different.
