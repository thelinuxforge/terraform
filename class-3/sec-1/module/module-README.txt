In AWS, Terraform modules are a way to organize and reuse code that can provision AWS resources. A module is essentially a container for multiple resources that are used together. By grouping related resources into a module, you can simplify the configuration and avoid duplicating code.

Key Components:
Module Structure: A module typically includes:

main.tf: Defines the core resources.
variables.tf: Declares input variables.
outputs.tf: Exposes outputs from the module.
Usage: Modules can be used within other Terraform configurations. You can reference a module by providing its source (local directory, Git repo, or Terraform Registry) and passing necessary inputs.

Example:

module "ec2_instance" {
  source = "./modules/ec2"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  ami = "ami-123456"
}

Benefits:
Code Reusability: Modules allow you to reuse infrastructure code across multiple environments or projects.
Consistency: Helps maintain consistent infrastructure by encapsulating best practices.
Abstraction: Hides complexity by exposing a simplified interface (input variables and outputs).

Types of Modules:
Public Modules: Available in the Terraform Registry, like the AWS VPC module, S3 module, etc.
Private Modules: Created and used within your organization for custom setups.
Modules help make your Terraform configurations more scalable and manageable when deploying infrastructure on AWS.
