Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp that allows you to define, provision, and manage infrastructure across various cloud providers, data centers, and services using a high-level configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) or JSON.

Key Features:

Multi-Cloud Management: Terraform can manage resources on multiple cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure.
Infrastructure as Code: Infrastructure is defined using code, which can be version-controlled and shared.
Execution Plans: Terraform provides a preview of changes before they are applied, ensuring predictability.
State Management: Terraform tracks the state of your infrastructure, allowing it to apply changes efficiently.
terraform destroy:
terraform destroy is a command used to delete all the resources defined in your Terraform configuration. It is the opposite of terraform apply, which creates or updates infrastructure.

Key Points:

Destruction of Resources: terraform destroy removes all resources defined in your Terraform configuration, effectively tearing down your infrastructure.
State File Update: After destroying the resources, Terraform updates the state file to reflect that no resources are currently managed by the configuration.
Safety and Review: Similar to terraform plan, it shows you a preview of what will be destroyed before proceeding, giving you the chance to review and confirm the destruction.
Typical Use Cases:

Cleanup: Use terraform destroy to clean up resources after they are no longer needed, especially in development or test environments.
Decommissioning: It’s also used when decommissioning infrastructure or when starting over with a new configuration.
Example:

bash
Copy code
# Destroy all resources managed by the current Terraform configuration
terraform destroy
In summary, while Terraform as a tool is used to manage infrastructure throughout its lifecycle, from creation to updates, terraform destroy is specifically used to tear down that infrastructure when it’s no longer needed.
