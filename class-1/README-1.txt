Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows you to define and provision data center infrastructure using a high-level configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) or JSON.

Key Features of Terraform:
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): You can describe your infrastructure using code, making it easy to version control, share, and reuse configurations.

Provider Agnostic: Terraform can manage infrastructure on multiple cloud providers such as AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, and on-premises environments using the same configuration files.

Execution Plans: Terraform generates an execution plan before making changes to your infrastructure, allowing you to see what will happen if you apply the configuration. This helps to avoid unintended consequences.

State Management: Terraform keeps track of the state of your infrastructure, enabling it to know what changes need to be applied. The state is stored in a file, usually named terraform.tfstate.

Resource Graph: Terraform builds a dependency graph of all resources, ensuring they are created, modified, or destroyed in the correct order.

Modular and Extensible: You can break down your configurations into smaller, reusable modules, making it easier to manage and scale your infrastructure.

Common Use Cases:
Provisioning Cloud Resources: Automatically creating and managing resources like VPCs, EC2 instances, storage buckets, etc., in the cloud.
Multi-Cloud Management: Managing resources across multiple cloud providers using a single tool.
Automating Infrastructure: Implementing continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for infrastructure.
Overall, Terraform is widely used in DevOps and cloud computing for automating the deployment and management of infrastructure.
